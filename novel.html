<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
<p>
It wasn't that such thunderstorms did not have a kind of wild beauty. They did, and
Bill appreciated -- had appreciated -- that, in his own way. No, it wasn't the storm
he particularly cared about, one way or the other. The properties and aesthetics of
thunderstorms were perfectly appropriate when put under the consideration of cool 
logic. Enjoy the sights. Don't go wandering on the high ground. Simple rules, of a 
rational nature. Clauses and stipulations that might be followed, or not, given ones
particular circumstances. No, he worried over more indirect effects of the storm,
certain unhealthy correlations. The sort of correlations that people tend not to talk
about, the kind that sit patiently in the back of the mind. 
</p>
<p>
That's exactly what they do, Bill thought. They sit patiently and cooly, like old
and punctual gentlemen. Elderly little men with sparkling eyes and spiderweb
wrinkles; the ones that look so gentle and kind, but that you somehow feel are quite 
probably not. They sit in the back the consciousness, waiting with downcast eyes and 
smiling, empty faces. Waiting until the onset of dusk. 
</p>
<p>
It was dusk now, as Bill stared out into the light rain and darkly shining sky. It was a 
dusk made darker by the storm.
